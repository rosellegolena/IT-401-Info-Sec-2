    Warm Greetings! Welcome to Oh my Goodies a one-stop place for you to meet and satisfy your cravings. We are committed to give you a comfortable and relaxing avenue for meetings and gatherings with luscious and delectable sweets.  
Founded in 2021 by Roselle, Hanna, Alliah, Nel, Jellie and Airam. OMG bake shop is a friendly business built by six friends.  It first started out by their passion on having their own business.  As years go by, they realized that they want to make their dreams come true and decided to build a bake shop. 
We now serve customers within the community and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly bake shop industry. OMG bake shop is now open to those people who want to treat themselves with delicious pastries that can make their day.
We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
